# README.md

The application is a Streamlit based web app which uses Google sheets, Google drive and a PostgreSQL database to visualize and analyze Interception Records Forms (IRFs) for specific regions. The application integrates several features such as authentication, data querying from databases, data cleaning and transformation, data visualization using Folium, and interaction with Google services.

## Features:

1. **Authentication**: The app has a built-in user authentication system with username/password pairs stored in a TOML file.

2. **Data Querying and Cleaning**: The app queries data from a PostgreSQL database and conducts subsequent data cleaning and transformations.

3. **Google Services Integration**: The app integrates with Google Drive and Google Sheets to download and load data files, and to work with structured data.

4. **Data Visualization**: The app utilizes Folium to create interactive maps for data visualization.

5. **Cache and Session Management**: Streamlit's caching and session state are used for efficiency and interactivity.

## Running the App:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Setup the environment with necessary credentials for database, Google Sheets and Google Drive access, and for user authentication.
4. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.

# User help functionality in Streamlit

Here is a simple example for creating a user help sidebar in the Streamlit app:

```python
# User help sidebar
st.sidebar.title('Help')
if st.sidebar.button('How to use this app?'):
    st.sidebar.write("""
    1. **Login**: Enter your username and password to log in.
    2. **Select Country**: Choose the country for which you want to analyze IRFs.
    3. **Select Date Range**: Choose a date range for which you want to analyze IRFs.
    4. **View Map**: View the map to see IRFs data visualized geographically.
    5. **Interact with Map**: Zoom, pan, and click on markers to interact with the map.
    6. **Logout**: Click the logout button when you are done.
    """)
```

# Improving and optimizing the code

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Break down the main function into smaller functions, each having a single responsibility. For example, querying data and data cleaning can be done in separate functions.

2. **Use Async IO for External Calls**: For functions that call external services (like Google Sheets or database queries), consider using Python's async IO to run these in parallel and speed up the app.

3. **Caching**: Use `@st.cache` on functions that load data from the database or Google Sheets to speed up the app by loading data from cache on subsequent runs.

4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling by providing user-friendly messages and handling exceptions at the app level.

5. **Optimize Data Transformations**: Use in-built pandas functions for data cleaning and transformations where possible as they are optimized for performance.

6. **Logging**: Consider using a more sophisticated logging setup for easier debugging. For instance, logging messages could be written to a file in addition to the console, and the log level could be configured through an environment variable.

7. **Code Comments and Docstrings**: Add more code comments and function docstrings to improve code readability and maintainability.

8. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys should be stored as environment variables or secure vaults.

9. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for the code to make sure every part of the code is working as expected, this will also make future code refactoring and debugging easier.

10. **Code Formatting and Linting**: Follow Python coding conventions and use code linters to ensure code quality.
